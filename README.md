## Can I contribute ?

Well offcourse you can, we will make sure that each issue will have label showing the difficulty level of that issue. It can be Easy, Medium, Hard. Easy labeled issues can be taken up by those who are new to Github and want to contribute something. We highly recommend other people to leave easy issues for other only if you think you can take Medium or higher level issues.

Also make sure that if you are working on any issue then make one comment saying that you want to work on it so that others may know that this issue is already assigned to someone else and he/she is already working on it. Try not to break these rules as it will maintain healthy behaviour among us.

## Best practices for contributition

Anyone can contribute to our open source project so feel free to do it. But make sure that you follow best practices which we have:

1. Make sure that git commit message is meaningful and easy to understand
2. While solving any issue make sure you reference it in commit message by mentioned issue id (#1, #2 etc)
3. Make sure you squash your commit if there are more than 2 commits while making any Pull Request. In case of difficulties feel free to ask for any assistance.
4. While making any Pull Request for UI make sure you attach one screenshot showing the final result or the bug which you have solved.
5. While creating any issue make sure you mention all the procedure required to generate that bug/error and have one brief description about that bug.
